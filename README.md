# cBridge
A collection of cBridge scripts and info. Mostly used to scrape info from elsewhere on the web.
These are bash scripts that if used, need to have execute permission (chmod +x <filename> )
They may not be the best, but they are simple and work for what our requirements are. The plus side to this,
while simple, ANYONE who can read and has a little bit of common sense, can modify these to make them work for what you need!!

The only magic in these is the awk portion. After modifying certain fields, the awk line
reorganizes them into the format we want to see. It is simple, but effective! This works well with .CSV files.
